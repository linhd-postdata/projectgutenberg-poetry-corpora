# Project Gutenberg Poetry Corpora

Using https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus, this repo contains the poetry part of Project Gutenberg for several languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

To download poetry in a specific language, you'll need a [dump file](http://static.decontextualize.com/gutenberg-dammit-files-v002.zip) and the [`build.py`](./build.py) script. More info can be found in https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/.
